We present a method for rela-time detection of hand gestures that employs a two phase image recognition pipeline, wherein hands are localized within the original input image, extracted, and fed into a convolutional neural network based classifier which outputs the detected gesture. Our results indicate that our method achieves a reasonable accuracy for real time detection on a predefined set of gestures.
